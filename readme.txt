An extensive yet user-friendly form block.

== Description ==

WordPress offers several (contact) form plugins, but most of them are not up-to-date anymore when it comes to creating forms. Form Block tackles this problem by utilizing the block editor's power. It enables you to create a form effortlessly within the block editor itself, which makes the process of creating a form much more enjoyable and similar to creating other types of blocks. This innovative approach to form creation ensures that Form Block stands out from other WordPress form plugins.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/form-block` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
1. Add the 'Form Block' block anywhere you want to enable a form in your block editor.
