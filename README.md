# Form Block

WordPress offers several (contact) form plugins, but most of them are not up-to-date anymore when it comes to creating forms. Form Block tackles this problem by utilizing the block editor's power. It enables you to create a form effortlessly within the block editor itself, which makes the process of creating a form much more enjoyable and similar to creating other types of blocks. This innovative approach to form creation ensures that Form Block stands out from other WordPress form plugins.
